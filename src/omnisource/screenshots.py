"""Screenshot validation, mirror and thumbnail generation.

This module is the static-site counterpart of the catalog ``screenshots`` array.
Catalog authors can declare remote screenshot URLs; the build pipeline

* validates that each URL is well-formed and points to an image,
* mirrors reachable screenshots to ``assets/screenshots/<slug>/...`` so the
  Pages deployment never depends on a third-party CDN,
* produces 480px wide WebP + PNG thumbnails for fast gallery rendering, and
* falls back to the existing app icon when no screenshot is reachable.

The module never raises during the build — every issue is recorded and the
final ``feeds/screenshots.json`` document lists what is in place. This keeps
the "missing screenshot" case from blocking feed generation.
