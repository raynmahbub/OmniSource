# OmniSource — major issues

Static review of `iamsmmh/OmniSource` @ `8edb83e` (branch `arena/01a09439-omnisource`).
Everything below was reproduced in the working tree; line numbers are from that commit.

**What is genuinely healthy:** 235 unit tests pass, `ruff check` + `ruff format --check` are
clean, `validate.py` / `publish_root.py --check` / `merge_feeds.py --check` /
`check_reproducible.py --diff` all pass, no secrets matched a credential scan, and the
Python-side HTML escaping (`src/omnisource/app_pages.py`) is thorough. The problems below are
the ones those checks cannot see.

## Status (2026-09-18, branch `arena/01a0b522-omnisource`)

| Item | Status | What happened |
| --- | --- | --- |
| F8 screenshot-host advisories | **Fixed** | The 15 standing `validate.py` warnings (hosts not equal to the app's upstream host) are now resolved by an explicit, dated allowlist: `data/screenshot_hosts.json` records the reviewed decision per host (`repo.ikghd.me` — iKarwan's depiction server, `apps.sidestore.io` — SideStore's own domain, `aidoku.app` — Aidoku's project site). `validate.py` reads it via `_screenshot_host_allowlist()`; anything not listed still warns. `validate.py` now reports **0 errors, 0 warnings**; `tests/test_screenshot_provenance.py` pins the allowlist shape, the no-warning outcome, and the fallback when the file is missing |
| F4 #6 home weight | **Budget pinned** | New `TestHomeWeightBudget` in `tests/test_website_shell.py`: the home page's first-paint JSON (catalog + `apps.json` + every feed declared `firstPaint: true` in `js/site.js`) must stay under 2 MiB (measured baseline 2026-09-18: ~1.47 MiB — well below the 2.4 MiB that motivated the report), and `apps.json` must not embed per-app release histories |
| F2 flaky `Sync & Publish` | **Observable, no recurrence since the fix window** | The 09-16/17 failure window predates the observability step; the `sync.yml` "Build feeds" step tees the pipeline to a log, and two `if: failure()` steps raise an `::error::` annotation with the log tail and upload `pipeline-log-<run_id>` as an artifact (verified present in the committed workflow). Runs checked green through 2026-09-18T15:33Z; the next real failure will be diagnosable from annotations without Azure blob access. Root cause remains unverified — there is nothing left to fix until it fails again |
| F4 #4 / #5 / #11 / #12 (hero clipping, `/sources/` 320 px, contrast, target sizes) | **Open — needs a layout engine** | Verified-against-code items only; this checkout has no browser or rendering engine, and the repo's own rule is not to claim pixel or contrast fixes from reading CSS. Unchanged by design |
| F4 #7 hot-linked media | **By design, now reviewed** | Catalog icons/screenshots intentionally point at developer-owned hosting (the provenance rule in `validation.py` plus the new host allowlist are the review surface); nothing to fix in code |
| F5 reputation cadence | **Open — retention decision** | The 70 null-cadence sources need per-app release history (a retention knob), which this report explicitly says is not a formula bug. Left as-is |
| uPro Plus naming | **Reverted** | The `youmod` catalog entry is named **YouMod** again (slug, feed URLs and upstream unchanged); the new **uProVid** app ships with the Tweak Factory `build` helper — see `docs/TWEAK-FACTORY.md` |

## Status (reviewed 2026-09-13, branch `arena/01a09925-omnisource`)

This table is the audit's own ledger, kept current so the document says what the
tree does. Line references below were written against `8edb83e`; a few files
listed here do not exist in this checkout (`scripts/update_docs.py`,
`src/omnisource/news.py`, `docs/reputation-analytics.md`,
`tests/test_pipeline_v2.py`, `src/omnisource/validate.py`) — where an item named
one, the equivalent code here is what was changed.

| # | Item | Status | What happened |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Shell injection in `build-tweak.yml` | **Fixed** | `env:`-only input passing, https-only URL validation, `tweak_name` sanitized to `[A-Za-z0-9._-]{1,64}` (see the workflow's *Sanitize inputs* step) |
| 2 | False “critical” dead-app takedowns | **Fixed** | `dead_apps._unexplained_removals()` escalates only when the disappeared release is *newer* than what is still published; `pipeline.stage_sync` stopped recording supersession and failover renames at all. Re-running the classifier over the committed `feeds/state.json`: `critical` 10 → 0, `count` 43 → 33 — the report's predicted outcome. Tests in `tests/test_intelligence.py` pin both directions |
| 3 | Full integrity verification never runs | **Fixed (workflow added)** | New `.github/workflows/verify.yml`: weekly `--verify-downloads --no-sync --no-health`, validates, commits `feeds/state.json` + the integrity report, exits non-zero on a digest/size mismatch. `pipeline.run` now forwards `only=` to `verify_downloads()`, so the job's per-app rerun option actually restricts the verification (it previously narrowed only the sync). `docs/SECURITY-REPORT.md` and `.github/workflows/README.md` name the job |
| 4 | Degenerate reputation cadence | **Partly fixed** | `utils.dates.version_dates()` gained `include_history`, and reputation scores/ages/365-day counts now merge the shared `updateHistory` timeline. Measured on the committed data: sources with `updateFrequencyDays: null` 77 → 70, four of them now clear the 85-point bar (`Verified` 0 → 5). **Still open:** the other 70 — `state[slug]["versions"]` is capped at `upstream.keepVersions` (1 for most apps) and `updateHistory` holds 100 events for the whole catalog, so most apps have exactly one dated release and *no interval exists to average*. That is a retention decision (per-app release history, or a larger timeline), not a formula bug. `compare.py` / `health_score.py` publish the per-app window on purpose and were left alone |
| 5 | `merge.yml` write token on `pull_request` | **Fixed** | Workflow-level `permissions: {}`; `contents: write` moved onto the push job (`if: github.event_name != 'pull_request'`); a new read-only `check` job runs the same merge/validate/reproducibility gate on PRs and fails when `apps.json` is not the merge output. Note `merge_feeds.py --check` cannot cover this: it verifies merge *inputs*, and the pipeline overwrites those files afterwards |
| 6 | RSS `lastBuildDate` churn | **Fixed** | `_render_channel` derives `<lastBuildDate>` from the newest item date (`_newest_date`, compared as datetimes — RFC 822 leads with the weekday, so a string `max` is wrong) and omits it for an empty feed. `_rfc822_date` no longer substitutes the current time for a missing/unparsable date: an item without a date emits no `<pubDate>`. The RSS renderer is now clock-free; `tests/test_rss.py` pins byte-equality across two renders |
| 7 | 15 apps share 4 bundle IDs | **Documented, deliberately open** | `validation.py` already *fails* the build on an undeclared shared bundle ID, so this cannot drift silently; the collisions themselves are the catalog's reality (multiple tweaks shipping one app) and de-duplicating them means changing published `bundleIdentifier` values for installed clients. See the note under item 7 |
| 8 | Unescaped data path in the detail dialog | **Fixed** | `js/site.js` escapes every `infoPanel` cell (markup-carrying cells opt out explicitly via `{label, raw}`) and the status-board sync cells; also the same class of bug found alongside it: `discover/index.html` (its card `href` was a literal `${app.slug}` inside a single-quoted string, so every card 404'd — unrelated to the report but the page was completely broken), `favorites/index.html`, and `js/features.js::_renderAppCard` |
| 9 | `generatedAt` is not a build timestamp | **Fixed** | `render_health_doc` stamps `generatedAt = today()` and exposes the previous value as `lastEventAt`. The README's “Last sync” line and `health-check.yml`'s staleness check both read it as a build time, so both were wrong on any week with no new release. `rendered == []` no longer raises in `max()` |
| 10 | Docs / CI drift | **Partly fixed** | The `verify.yml` half is closed (item 3). **Not done:** the `docs/` reorganisation half — this checkout has no generated-docs pipeline (`scripts/update_docs.py` is absent), so the hand-written `docs/*.md` set was edited in place instead of restructured |

Rows 2, 4, 6 and 9 change generator output, so the published corpus is
regenerated in the same branch: 44 documents differ in content (the health
stamp, the reputation cadence and scores, the dead-app board, the source pages
that embed those scores, and the install document) and the rest is the
`generatedAt`/`<lastmod>` refresh the same build performs. The split is not a
style choice — `feeds/api/v2/manifest.json` pins the sha256 of every v2 document
and `tests/test_api_v2.py` checks the pins, so a partially regenerated corpus
fails: reverting the date-stamped per-app documents broke the manifest digest.
`scripts/check_reproducible.py` (both modes) is green on the result, 697
generated files stable.

## CI failures (reviewed 2026-09-13, branch `arena/01a09c23-omnisource`)

Each item below was reproduced locally before and after the fix. The review
started from runs
[34765462173](https://github.com/iamsmmh/OmniSource/actions/runs/34765462173/job/103745515346)
(Sync & Publish) and
[34766172646](https://github.com/iamsmmh/OmniSource/actions/runs/34766172646/job/103747416461)
(Discovery); over the last 100 runs the red workflows were `Sync & Publish`
7/7, `Discovery` 2/2, `Backup and Recovery` 2/2, `Validate` 3/10 and
`Merge Feeds` 1/3.

| # | Symptom | Root cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| C1 | `Sync & Publish` fails at *Verify generated artifacts are reproducible* on **every** run — so feeds never publish and Pages never deploys — and `Validate`/`Merge Feeds` fail the same step whenever the committed ledger carries telemetry | `reports/latest.json` embedded **run-scoped** sync telemetry (`sync.synced/incrementalHits/updated/failed/apiRequests`, `updates`, `errors`). The checker rebuilds with `--no-sync`, whose fresh `SyncReport` is all zeros, so the rebuild always differed from the sync before it. `reports/history.json` shows the artifact: a real row (`updated: 18, failed: 17, errors: 17`) followed by a fake zero row from the same day | `reports.py` carries the run-scoped blocks forward when a run performed no sync (`write_reports(sync_ran=…)`, set from `pipeline.run`): the ledger keeps describing the last real sync and an offline rebuild is byte-identical. Verified with a real `--incremental` sync (131 API requests, 17 upstream failures) → `check_reproducible.py`: *697 generated file(s) stable* |
| C2 | `Discovery` fails at *Validate discoveries (invalid sources never publish)* on every run that finds anything | `remote_validation.validate_source_record` checked `source_id` against `SLUG_RE` — the 32-char **catalog app slug** rule — while `autodiscovery.source_id_for_url` generates `host-stem-digest` ids of up to 80 chars, exactly as `schemas/discovery.schema.json` allows. Reproduced: 166 repository candidates → `166 error(s)`, all *source_id must be a lowercase slug* | New `SOURCE_ID_RE` (`^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]{1,79}$`) matching the schema, and `source_id_for_url` sanitizes the host as well as the path, so ids are schema-valid by construction (IDN hosts included). `discover_repositories.py` now validates candidates with the same rules the gate applies, so a pass cannot write records the next step rejects. Verified: 166 candidates → `0 error(s)` |
| C3 | `Backup and Recovery` fails at *Snapshot catalog, feeds, data, and API* on every scheduled run (exit 2) — the repository had **no** disaster-recovery snapshots at all | `backup.yml` passed `--label scheduled`; `create_backup.py` accepts only `daily/weekly/monthly/manual`, so argparse exited 2 before snapshotting | The job reads the cron that fired it from `$GITHUB_EVENT_PATH` (no `${{ }}` in the shell) and maps it to its tier, `manual` for a dispatch. `backup.LABELS` is now the single source of truth for the taxonomy and `tests/test_ops.py` pins the workflow's labels *and* its cron mapping to it. Verified: `create --label daily` → *894 files, verified=True* |
| C4 | The published root `/security-report.json` disappears between runs | `site._prune_mirror` kept only `{apps.json, sitemap.xml, robots.txt, .nojekyll, catalog.json}` at the root, so every build deleted the report `security.yml` commits — and `sync.yml`'s `git add -A -- '*.json'` published the deletion. `publish_root.py --check` and `tests/test_website_shell.py` both treated the file as owned: the code contradicted its own documentation | `ROOT_EXTERNALLY_PUBLISHED` keeps it; `publish_root.py` derives its `owned` set from `site.py` so the two cannot drift again; a regression test asserts the publisher never prunes another workflow's root document |
| C5 | `Security` run 34748720624: *The job was not started because it repeatedly failed to be acquired (5 attempts)* | GitHub runner capacity, not a repository defect | None needed — 10/11 security runs are green |

Three further defects surfaced while reproducing the above, all fixed:

* **Untrusted input crashed the fail-closed gate.** `assert_publishable`
  compared `record.get("reputation", 0) < 25` and `quarantine._source_fields`
  called `int()` on the same field; a third-party feed that puts a string
  there raised `TypeError`/`ValueError`, so one malformed candidate took the
  whole validation gate down with a traceback instead of being quarantined.
  Both coerce safely now, and a non-integer reputation is reported as the
  schema error it already was.
* **A single bad record wedged `discovery.yml` permanently.** The validate
  step failed *before* the commit step, so the quarantine it prescribed was
  never persisted and every later run hit the same record — the runbook in
  `docs/OPERATIONS.md` said "quarantine the offending record, re-run", by
  hand. `validate_source.py --quarantine-invalid` isolates invalid records
  (fail-closed: they leave the store, so they can never publish) and stays
  green so the commit persists the quarantine; it still fails when isolation
  is impossible or when an already verified/published record is invalid,
  which is a genuine breach. Default and `--strict` behaviour is unchanged
  for the read-only `validation.yml` gate.

* **Every documented backup command was invalid.** `docs/OPERATIONS.md` and
  `docs/DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md` both told operators to run
  `create --label drill`, `verify --backup <dir>` and
  `restore --backup <dir> --destination <dir> --dry-run`: `drill` is not a
  label, and `verify`/`restore` take the snapshot directory *positionally*
  (`restore` is a dry run unless `--apply` is given, `--root` names the target
  tree). The recovery runbook could not be executed as written. Both are
  corrected, and `docs/MIGRATION.md` pointed at `scripts/derived/*.py` for
  three builders that live at `scripts/*.py`. A sweep of all 34 documented
  `python3 scripts/…` invocations (plus every workflow and the Makefile) now
  resolves against the real argparse definitions.

Also latent, now guarded: `sync.yml`'s deploy job calls `actions/deploy-pages`,
which **fails** while Pages is set to *Deploy from a branch* — this
repository's setting (`build_type: legacy`) — rather than "simply ignoring the
artifact" as `.github/workflows/README.md` claimed. The job had never executed
because the build job always failed first, so fixing C1 would have moved the
failure there. It now probes the Pages `build_type` and deploys only in
Actions mode, and the docs describe what actually happens.

## P0 — High

### 1. Shell injection in `build-tweak.yml` (CWE-94)

`.github/workflows/build-tweak.yml:70,72,79,83` interpolate `workflow_dispatch` inputs directly
into `run:` shell text:

```yaml
curl -L "${{ inputs.base_ipa_url }}" -o workspace/base.ipa
curl -L "${{ inputs.tweak_deb_url }}" -o workspace/tweak.deb
FLAGS+=(-b "${{ inputs.bundle_id }}")
FLAGS+=(-n "${{ inputs.app_name }}")
```

Anyone who can dispatch this workflow gets arbitrary command execution on the runner. The job
declares `permissions: contents: write` and checks out with credentials persisted, so the
`GITHUB_TOKEN` in `.git/config` is in reach.

The sibling workflow already knows better — `build-uyouenhanced.yml:87-98` passes every input
through `env:` with the comment *"workflow_dispatch inputs are passed through the environment
rather than interpolated into `run:` scripts, which would allow shell injection."* Same file,
opposite decision.

**Fix:** mirror `build-uyouenhanced.yml` — move all four inputs into the job `env:` block and
reference them as `"$IN_BASE_IPA_URL"` etc.

---

### 2. Dead-app detection produces false "critical" takedowns

**Status:** fixed in `dead_apps._unexplained_removals` + `pipeline.stage_sync`; see the table above.

`src/omnisource/pipeline.py:295-305` records a `removedReleases` entry whenever the previously
newest version is absent from the freshly resolved set, and `src/omnisource/dead_apps.py:60-70`
turns any such entry into `classification: "critical"` with the reason *"removed upstream
release(s): …"*.

That test cannot distinguish a takedown from two routine events:

* **Ordinary version bumps.** 75 of 77 catalog rows use `upstream.keepVersions: 1`, so only the
  newest asset is ever offered. `iqface` moved `577.1 → 578.1` and was flagged critical even
  though `578.1` is live.
* **Failover between provider legs.** `swiftgram` still publishes `12.9.2`, but the URL changed
  `Swiftgram-12.9.2-MxGram.ipa → Swiftgram-12.9.2-iQTele.ipa` — same version, different build —
  and that was recorded as a removed release.

Live state for all nine: current download reachable, `HTTP 200`.

| slug | current version | flagged as removed | actual health |
|---|---|---|---|
| iqface | 578.1 | 577.1 | HTTP 200 |
| messenger-flow | 578.1.0 | 577.0.0 | HTTP 200 |
| msgplusx | 578.1.0 | 577.0.0 | HTTP 200 |
| ryukgram | 446.0.0 | 445.0.0 | HTTP 200 |
| sparkle | 446.0.0 | 445.0.0 | HTTP 200 |
| swiftgram | 12.9.2 | 12.9.2 (failover rename) | HTTP 200 |
| telegram-mxgram | 12.9.3 | 12.9.3 (failover rename) | HTTP 200 |
| threadsaver | 446.1 | 445.1 | HTTP 200 |
| turrit-mxgram | 1.5.3 | 1.5.3 (failover rename) | HTTP 200 |

Net effect: `api/dead_apps.json` publishes **33 of 77 apps (43%) as dead**, including 9 as
critical, while the README advertises *"77/77 downloads online"*. `tests/test_intelligence.py:183`
currently asserts the buggy behaviour, so the suite locks it in.

**Fix:** only record a removal when the previous version is *newer* than the current one (a real
rollback) or the old URL fails a probe. Otherwise treat it as supersession and clear the flag.

---

### 3. Full integrity verification never runs

**Status:** fixed — `.github/workflows/verify.yml` now exists and commits the results.

`--verify-downloads` exists at `src/omnisource/cli.py:25-28` and `src/omnisource/integrity.py:185`,
but **no workflow invokes it**, and `src/omnisource/integrity.py:19-20` plus `pipeline.py:839`
document a *"weekly `verify.yml` job"* that is not in `.github/workflows/`.

Evidence: `feeds/state.json` has `lastFullVerification` on **0 of 77 apps**.

So the README's *"SHA-256, verification labels and automated probes keep every download
installable"* is metadata-only: 50/77 apps carry an upstream-published digest, 27 carry none, and
**not one digest is ever checked against the bytes it describes**. The pipeline never streams an
IPA.

**Fix:** add the missing scheduled workflow (the code is written and waiting), or soften the
README claim to "checksums published upstream are surfaced, not verified".

---

### 4. Reputation scores are degenerate — no source can reach "Verified"

**Status:** partly fixed — the cadence now reads the shared timeline (77 → 70 nulls); the remaining 70 need longer retained release history, not a formula change.

Root cause: `catalog.json` sets `upstream.keepVersions: 1` for 75 of 77 apps, so
`feeds/state.json` holds exactly **one** version for 76 apps (one app keeps 3).

Consequences, visible in `api/reputation.json`:

* `updateFrequencyDays` is `None` for **60 of 61** sources, so `_compose_score` falls back to
  `cadence = 0.35` (`src/omnisource/reputation.py:208`) — the 20-point update-frequency signal is
  a constant, not a signal.
* **49 of 61 sources score exactly 73.9.** The score does not discriminate between Aidoku and a
  dormant side project.
* The `Verified` band needs `score >= 85`, which is unreachable while the second-largest weight is
  pinned at 0.35. Result: **0 sources are Verified**; 80% land in "Community Verified" — even
  though the README FAQ presents *Verified* as a live status and `feeds/sources.json` v2 publishes
  `updateFrequencyDays` and `verifiedApps` as if they were meaningful.

Downstream, the same missing history weakens trending, the "update cadence" column on
`/sources/`, and the 90/180/365-day dead-app thresholds (which compare against a single data point).

**Fix:** raise `keepVersions` to ~5–10 (the knob already exists), or compute cadence and release
activity from `state["updateHistory"]` — which already holds 85 real update events — instead of
`state[slug]["versions"]`.

---

## P1 — Medium

### 5. `merge.yml` executes PR-authored code with a write-scoped token

**Status:** fixed — `contents: write` is on the push job only, and PRs get a read-only `check` job.

`.github/workflows/merge.yml` triggers `on: pull_request`, grants `permissions: contents: write`
at the top level, checks out the PR merge ref with `persist-credentials` left at its default, and
then runs `scripts/merge_feeds.py` and `scripts/publish_root.py` **from that ref**. The
`paths: feeds/*.json` filter only decides *whether* it fires — it does not limit what is checked
out, so a PR can rewrite the scripts that run.

The commit step is correctly gated to `push`, so there is no direct push-to-main primitive, but
the token is still materialised in `.git/config` for whatever the PR's code does.

**Fix:** split into a read-only `pull_request` job (`persist-credentials: false`, `contents: read`)
and a privileged `push` job, or gate the whole job on `github.event_name == 'push'`.

### 6. RSS timestamp churn defeats the reproducibility gate and dirties the tree

**Status:** fixed — `lastBuildDate` comes from the newest item and the module no longer reads the clock.

`src/omnisource/feeds/rss.py:152` stamps `<lastBuildDate>` with wall-clock time
(`_now_rfc822()`), and `scripts/check_reproducible.py:90` then normalises that exact field away
before comparing.

Running `make check` therefore leaves **79 committed files modified** — timestamp-only diffs. I hit
this and reverted with `git checkout -- .`; `git status` is clean again.

In CI the same churn means `sync.yml`'s `git diff --cached --quiet` never reports "no changes", so
every 6-hour schedule produces a commit and a Pages redeploy even when nothing upstream moved. The
"generated artifacts are reproducible" gate passes only because it is configured to ignore the
thing that always changes.

**Fix:** derive `lastBuildDate` from the newest item's `pubDate` (deterministic), or have
`check_reproducible.py` restore the tree it mutated and drop the normaliser.

### 7. 15 of 77 apps collide on 4 bundle IDs in the single installable feed
**Status:** documented only — deliberately. `validation.py:97-124` already
FAILs a build whose shared bundle ID is undeclared, so the silent version of this
bug is closed; the collisions are real catalog data (several tweaks ship as one
app) and "fixing" them means changing the `bundleIdentifier` a client already
installed against, which is a catalog decision rather than a code one.


`api/duplicates.json`:

| bundle identifier | apps |
|---|---|
| `com.google.ios.youtube` | 7 |
| `com.atebits.Tweetie2` | 3 |
| `com.burbn.instagram` | 3 |
| `com.google.ios.youtubemusic` | 2 |

AltStore-family clients key on bundle ID, so a user adding the one URL the project markets
(`/apps.json`) gets an arbitrary member of each collision group, and SideStore cannot add two at
all. The README carries a tip about this and the site renders a "Shared bundle ×N" badge — but
roughly **19% of the catalog is not reliably installable from the master feed**, which is the
product's headline feature.

**Fix:** exclude colliding apps from `apps.json` and ship them only as per-app feeds, or publish
one master feed per collision group.

### 8. One unescaped data path in the app detail dialog

**Status:** fixed, plus the same pattern in `discover/`, `favorites/` and `js/features.js`.

`js/site.js:1115` puts `app.developerName` into the `infoPanel` cell array raw, and
`categoryLabel()` (`js/site.js:94`) falls through to the raw category string for any value not in
`CATEGORY_LABELS`. `js/site.js:1135` then prints `cell[1]` **without** `OS.esc` —
unlike every neighbouring value, which is escaped.

The page CSP is `script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'` (`src/omnisource/app_pages.py:37`), so an
injected inline handler would execute. Practical risk today is low: both fields come from the
maintainer-edited `catalog.json`. It becomes live the moment either is sourced from an upstream
feed (as `versionDescription` already is — that one *is* escaped, `js/site.js:1086`).

**Fix:** `OS.esc(app.developerName || '—')` and escape inside `categoryLabel`, or escape `cell[1]`
at the render site and drop the pre-built HTML from the cells that need it.

---

## P2 — Low / consistency

### 9. `api/health.json` `generatedAt` is not a build timestamp

**Status:** fixed — build date in `generatedAt`, newest event in `lastEventAt`.

`render_health_doc` (`src/omnisource/feeds/altstore.py:100-108`) sets `generatedAt` to
`max(statusSince, versionDate)` — the newest *app release* date, not when the build ran. It reads
`2026-09-11` while every sibling document from the same build reads `2026-09-12`, so the published
health feed looks a day stale whenever no app happened to ship.

### 10. Docs and CI drift
**Status:** partly fixed — the advertised-but-missing `verify.yml` now exists;
the `docs/` reorganisation was not attempted in this checkout (no generated-docs
pipeline here, so `docs/*.md` was edited in place).


* `src/omnisource/integrity.py:19-20` and `pipeline.py:839` describe a `verify.yml` job that does

* `docs/` mixes reference material (`API.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md`) with
  one-off phase write-ups (`FINAL-SUMMARY.txt`, `IMPLEMENTATION-SUMMARY.md`, `cleanup-report.md`,
  `REPOSITORY.md`, `FEATURES-P0-P3.md`) in a tree that GitHub Pages publishes.

## Suggested order of work

1. **Issue 1** — one-file change, closes a real injection hole.
2. **Issue 3** — the workflow is already written; wiring it up also fixes issue 10's doc drift.
3. **Issue 2** — small logic change; stops 9 healthy apps being published as dead.
4. **Issue 4** — flip `keepVersions` (or rewire cadence to `updateHistory`); unblocks the
   reputation, trending and cadence features at once.
5. **Issues 5, 6, 7** — CI hardening, build determinism, and feed layout.
6. **Issues 8, 9** — escaping consistency and a misleading timestamp.
